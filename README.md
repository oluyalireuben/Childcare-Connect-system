## Project Overview
Childcare_Connect is a web-based platform that connects parents with childcare providers. 
Both user types, parents and providers, can register and log in to their respective dashboards. 
Parents can search for and chat with providers, while providers can manage service requests from parents. 
The platform offers secure registration, in-app messaging, and more.
